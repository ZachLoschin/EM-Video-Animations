Scene 1: Maximum Likelihood Estimation Intro

Scene 2: Super Basic Review of MLE 

Scene 3: The Problem with MLE - Latent variables

Scene 4: EM as the ML solution to fitting latent variable models

Scene 5: EM theory - modeled after Bishop general EM section

Scene 6: Introduce the clustering problem as a latent variable model

Scene 7: Introduce general idea of EM

Scene 8: Show derivation of EM equations for GMM -> this is so important because I feel like its easy
to lose how you actually apply the theory if you don't see this at least once.
    - We can do some animations of the figures in Bishop

Scene 9: Show real GMM example and LL surface

Scene 10: review
